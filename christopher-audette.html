<p>I love how Chris worked my sale and especially appreciated his ability to work under less than ideal conditions. His care and finesse in handling this sale was really special. I forward to working with him in the future. <br /> <strong>Jesse Bobrowski</strong></p>
<p>Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you soooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <strong>Giovanna and William S.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so Much for all you have done for us. We enjoy working with you.<br /> <strong>Kelvin and Melanie C</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Chris for your information. Extremely helpful and much appreciated!!<br /> <strong>Leiana T</strong></p>
<p>I am an experienced buyer and seller but I have never had multiple unconditional offers. Chris did an excellent job of working with the interested buyers to negotiate all of my conditions and a selling price above the appraised value of my home. I would not hesitate to work with him again. I appreciate you helping those times when I wasn't able to get things in order for viewings (and photoshoots). <br /> <strong>Steven D</strong></p>
